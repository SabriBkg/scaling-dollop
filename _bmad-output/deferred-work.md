# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of story-1-1 (2026-04-06)

- STRIPE_TOKEN_KEY placeholder is an invalid Fernet key — `cp .env.example .env` gives a non-functional encryption key. Must generate a real key before Story 1.2 (Stripe token encryption).
- `redis` package unpinned in `requirements.txt` — all other packages are pinned. A major version bump could break Celery/Django cache integration silently.
- `production.py` re-creates `environ.Env()` instead of reusing the instance from `base.py` — shadows the base `env`, no `read_env()` called. Works because Railway injects real env vars, but inconsistent with the base pattern.

- `AuditLog.save()` immutability guard is bypassable via `QuerySet.update()` and `bulk_update()` — Django ORM bulk operations skip `save()`. Requires DB-level REVOKE on UPDATE/DELETE for the app PostgreSQL role, or a custom manager that overrides `update()`/`delete()`.
- `isRefreshing` and `failedQueue` in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` are module-level globals that persist across SSR requests in Next.js server context. If the axios instance is ever used server-side, one user's refresh flow could bleed into another's. Fix when adding SSR data fetching.

## Deferred from: code review of story-1-3 (2026-04-08)

- `is_within_payday_window` checks only `dt.day in (1, 15)` without converting to UTC — inconsistent with `next_payday_retry_window` which produces UTC-aware windows. Not used in production yet; fix when wiring payday scheduling in Story 3.2.
- `get_compliant_action` uses an allowlist of non-retry actions (`fraud_flag`, `notify_only`, `no_action`). If new action types are added, they could bypass geo-blocking. The action set is fixed by current spec; revisit if action types expand.

## Deferred from: code review of story-2-1 (2026-04-10)

- Unauthenticated `initiate_stripe_connect` endpoint creates a cache entry per POST with no rate limiting — attacker can flood Redis with `stripe_oauth_state:*` keys. Needs rate limiting middleware or throttle class.
- Dockerfile runs as root with no `USER` directive and installs Poetry via `curl | python3` without checksum verification. Address when hardening container security.
- Missing env vars (`STRIPE_REDIRECT_URI`, `STRIPE_CLIENT_ID`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`) cause unhandled `ImproperlyConfigured` crash. Add startup validation or graceful error handling.

## Deferred from: code review of story-2-2 (2026-04-10)

- `Subscriber.email` is `EmailField` but `failure_ingestion.py` stores unvalidated strings from Stripe via `get_or_create` (bypasses Django field validators). Malformed emails could cause downstream failures in email-sending features.
- No `db_index` on `SubscriberFailure.failure_created_at` — date-range queries will full-scan the table. Add index when dashboard query patterns are established.
- `get_rule()` in `core/engine/rules.py` crashes on `None` input with `AttributeError` — currently protected by caller defaulting to `"_default"`, but function contract is misleading. Fix when touching the rules engine.

## Deferred from: code review of story-2-3 (2026-04-10)

- `useAccount` query fires without auth gate (`enabled` flag) — fires 401 on unauthenticated page loads within dashboard layout. Consider gating with `enabled: !!isAuthenticated`.
- Dashboard layout flash of unauthenticated shell before middleware redirect — no client-side auth guard in `(dashboard)/layout.tsx`. Relies on middleware + axios 401 interceptor.
- `useAccount` error state unhandled in consumers — failed account fetch silently degrades WorkspaceIdentity (shows "Workspace" with no owner). No error UI or retry prompt.
- UserMenu shows "?" avatar before auth hydration completes — no skeleton/loading state for null `user` in authStore.
- Mobile navigation inaccessible below `md:` breakpoint — nav tabs hidden with no hamburger or fallback. Mobile is read-only MVP; needs a dedicated mobile nav story.

## Deferred from: code review of story-2-4 (2026-04-11)

- `toLocaleString()` locale-dependent number formatting — `total_failures.toLocaleString()` renders differently per browser locale (e.g., "1.000" in German vs "1,000" in English). Pre-existing pattern across the frontend.
- `recovery_rate` can theoretically exceed 100% — no model-level constraint prevents `recovered_count > total_subscribers` from data inconsistency. Needs database-level validation when touching the recovery engine.
- Frontend `recovery_action` TypeScript union vs backend string field — DB `classified_action` allows any string up to 50 chars but TS type restricts to 4 known values. If new actions are added to `DECLINE_RULES`, frontend silently falls back to wrong indicator color.

## Deferred from: code review of story-2-1b (2026-04-12)

- `ScopedRateThrottle` in `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` silently passes endpoints without a `throttle_scope` — `AllowAny` endpoints like `initiate_stripe_connect` and `stripe_connect_callback` have no rate limiting. An attacker could flood the cache with state tokens or exhaust DB connections. [backend/safenet_backend/settings/base.py:103]
- `stripe.error.StripeError` may not exist in Stripe SDK v15 — `backend/core/views/stripe.py:93` catches `stripe.error.StripeError` but Stripe v15 moved exceptions to `stripe.StripeError`. Falls through to generic exception handler. [backend/core/views/stripe.py:93]

## Deferred from: code review of story-2-5 (2026-04-13)

- `polling.py:120` uses pre-v15 `stripe.error.RateLimitError` — dead exception handler if SDK v15 removed this path. Rate limit errors would crash the polling task instead of retrying with backoff. Story spec says DO NOT fix in this story.
- Free-tier polling gate relies on Redis cache key `poll:last_run:{account_id}` with 48h TTL — cache eviction (memory pressure, restart) resets the gate, allowing Free accounts to poll at hourly rate instead of intended 15-day interval. Architectural decision: consider persisting last_poll_at in the database.
- Engine activation flow (DPA + mode selection) not presented after upgrade — AC4 clause 3 of Story 2-5 references this flow, but DPA UI is Story 3-1 (backlog). Wire up `engine_active` check post-upgrade when Story 3-1 is built.

## Deferred from: code review of story-3-1 (2026-04-14)

- Expired trial accounts retain Mid-tier privileges for up to 24h until daily celery beat job runs. `set_engine_mode` and `is_engine_active` don't inline-check trial expiry. Architectural decision: consider calling `check_and_degrade_trial` inline in account-mutating endpoints, or increasing celery beat frequency.
- Frontend stale cache after webhook-driven downgrade — React Query continues showing `engine_active: true`, old tier, and engine mode until next refetch (window focus or polling interval). Would need WebSocket/SSE push or shorter staleTime to mitigate.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` defaults to empty string at module level — warning logs and runtime guard added in story 2-5 review, but should be a hard startup error in production environments to prevent fail-open risk.
